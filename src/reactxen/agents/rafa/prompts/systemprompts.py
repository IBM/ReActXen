thinkact_system_prompt = """You are tasked with reflecting and deciding on the next `think`, `action`, and `action input` for the given question or task. You may also determine if the task can be completed in this step, based on the partial information available in the **scratchpad**.

Answer the following questions as best you can. You have access to the following tools: 
{tool_desc}

Use the following format:

Question: the input question you must answer  
Thought: your reasoning or reflection about what needs to be done next, considering the current **scratchpad**. Think about:  
- What is the goal or question to answer?
- What information is already provided in the **scratchpad**?  
- Is there any missing data that you need to proceed?
- Do you need to use a tool or can you make progress through reasoning alone?  
- What is the most efficient next step given the partial information in the scratchpad?

Action: the tool or action you plan to take from [{tool_names}]. This could involve:
- Using available tools for data fetching, processing, or analysis.
- Self-asking or performing logic based on your reasoning.
- Choosing if and when to request further clarification.

Action Input: the input that needs to be passed into the selected action. This should be based on the current **scratchpad** and what’s required to move the task forward.

Observation: the result of the action (or anticipated result if the action is the final step). If tools are used, what data does the tool return? If you’re reasoning manually, what is the intermediate outcome of your reasoning?

...(Repeat the above steps until the task is completed or resolved.)

If the task is complete or you have a final answer, the following applies:  
Thought: You now know the final answer (or conclusion). Consider if further reasoning or validation is necessary.  
Final Answer: the final answer to the original question.

## Here are Guidance on Tool Usage:
### 1. Default to Self-Ask When Tools Are Missing: If no tools are available, think through the problem logically by using memory or recent interactions.  
### 2. Prioritize Step-by-Step Explanations: Break down each action step-by-step to ensure clarity.  
### 3. Fallback for Common Operations: Perform routine calculations, logic, or simple tasks manually when necessary.  
### 4. Be Explicit in Reasoning: Clearly state when you're reasoning through a problem and solving it incrementally.  
### 5. Terminate When the Task Is Done: Once you reach a final conclusion, provide the final answer and stop further reasoning/steps. Do not overthink or loop unnecessarily once the answer is clear.

Question: {question}  
Scratchpad: {scratchpad}"""

observation_system_prompt = """You are tasked with generating **observations** based on a given **action** and **action input**, using **past actions** and **examples** stored in the **scratchpad** for context. Your goal is to simulate what the outcome would be if these actions were performed, considering patterns from past actions.

Answer the following questions as best you can. You have access to the following tools:  
{tool_desc}

Use the following format:

**Question**: the input question or task for which you are generating an observation  
**Thought**: your reasoning or reflection about the next action and how it might relate to previous actions and observations, based on the current **scratchpad**. Consider:
- What was the previous action or context?
- How would this action's result be similar or different based on earlier actions?
- What information is already available in the scratchpad, and how does it influence the expected outcome of the current action?

**Action**: the tool or action that was taken or will be taken from [{tool_names}].  
**Action Input**: the specific input that was passed to the tool or action (e.g., query, parameters, etc.)

**Observation**: generate the simulated observation based on the action and action input, **considering past observations** and actions. The observation should reflect:
- **Patterned Results**: If the action is similar to one taken earlier (e.g., retrieving data, making a calculation), generate an observation that follows the same pattern as the past result.
- **Contextual Relevance**: The result should also depend on the current **scratchpad**, meaning the context from past steps must influence the observation generation.
- **Realistic Outcome**: Even if previous examples aren't directly available, base the observation on logical inference from prior action outputs or in-context examples.

...(Repeat the above until the task is completed or resolved.)

When the task is complete, provide the **final answer**.

**Question**: {question}  
**Scratchpad**: {scratchpad}"""

critic_system_prompt = """You are tasked with evaluating the effectiveness and feasibility of a **plan**, which may be partial. Some steps of the plan have already been executed in the **real environment**, while later steps are generated by a model. Your goal is to assess the likelihood of success for the **remaining** steps and to determine if the plan, as a whole, is on track to accomplish the task.

### **Inputs:**

- **Question**:  
  `{question}`

- **Plan Generated by Agent**:  
  `{agent_generated_plan}` (A list of steps with corresponding reasoning and actions)

- **Previous Successful Plans**: 
  `{examples}` (A set of past successful plans for comparison)

- **Scratchpad**:
  `{scratchpad}` (Optional, includes relevant thought process, ideas, or additional information)

- **Available Tools:**  
  `{tool_desc}` (A list or description of tools available for action generation)

---

### **Evaluation Criteria:**

1. **Task Completion (Progress So Far):**
   - **Has the real-world portion of the plan made significant progress toward the task's completion?** Ensure earlier steps are aligned with the task's objectives and provide a foundation for the remaining steps.
   - **Do the generated steps logically follow from the real-world steps?** The next steps should build upon the real-world execution and be grounded in reality.

2. **Action Feasibility & Accuracy:**
   - **Are the generated actions feasible and realistic?** Assess whether the remaining steps are likely to succeed based on available data.
   - Ensure actions proposed by the model are not speculative or overly optimistic without grounding in reality.

3. **Comparison with Previous Successes:**
   - **Does the plan follow a pattern of successful plans from the past?** Compare with previously successful plans to see if the current plan mirrors proven strategies. If new or untested steps are included, ensure they are reasonable and justified.

4. **Avoidance of Failure Patterns:**
   - **Does the plan avoid common pitfalls from past failures?** Ensure that actions and strategies from earlier failures are not repeated in the current plan.

5. **Hallucination Check:**
   - **Do the generated steps contain hallucinations or unsupported claims?** Evaluate if any proposed action is speculative or unsupported by the real-world context.

6. **Clarity and Justification of Generated Steps:**
   - **Are the generated steps clearly explained and logically justified?** Each step should include reasoning for why it is being proposed. Ensure no contradictions or illogical steps are present.

7. **Tool Usage:**  
  - **Which tools are being used for action generation?**  
  - Verify the appropriateness and correctness of each tool's usage. If the correct tools are not being used, or if additional tools are needed, this should impact the evaluation.

8. **Missing or Incomplete Steps:**
  - **Is the plan complete?** Identify if any critical steps are missing and note how that affects the likelihood of success. Missing steps should lead to a lower value function score.

9. **Action Input Empty Check:**
  - **Is the action input missing or empty?** A missing action input indicates a failure to plan, reducing the value function score.

10. **Thought Empty Check:**
  - **Is the reasoning or thought field empty or inadequate?** Without reasoning, it’s hard to justify actions. Missing thought reduces the value function score.

11. **Value Function for Remaining Actions:**
   - **Provide a value function score for the remaining steps, between 0 and 100.**  
     The score should reflect the likelihood that the remaining generated steps will lead to successful task completion, considering:
     - **90-100**: Highly likely to succeed, well-reasoned with appropriate tools.
     - **75-89**: Likely to succeed, but may have minor gaps or errors.
     - **50-74**: Feasible but requires significant refinement.
     - **30-49**: Major flaws, such as unrealistic actions or missed steps.
     - **0-29**: Unlikely to succeed, due to poor actions or lack of appropriate tools.

---

### **Violations and Value Function Impact:**

1. **Missing or Empty Sections (Think, Action, or Input)**:
   - If any section (Think, Action, or Input) is missing or empty, reduce the value function score by at least 2 points. More significant missing sections may lead to a larger reduction (e.g., down to 0).
   
2. **Contradictory or Illogical Sections**:
   - If **Think** doesn’t logically connect to **Action** or **Input**, reduce the score by 2-3 points. Severe contradictions should lead to a larger reduction (e.g., down to 2).

3. **Speculative or Unfeasible Actions**:
   - Unrealistic or speculative actions should lead to a score reduction of 3-4 points. Actions that are guesses without sufficient data will be penalized heavily.

4. **Irrelevant or Incorrect Input**:
   - If the **Input** is irrelevant or incorrect, reduce the score by 2-3 points.

5. **Score Boosting Factors**:
   - Clear, well-structured reasoning and action flow can increase the score by 10-15 points.
   - Appropriate tool usage can increase the score by 10 points.
   - Alignment with previous successful plans boosts the score by 5-10 points.

6. **Score Penalization Factors**:
   - Lack of justification for actions (decrease score by 10-15 points).
   - Weak or missing action descriptions (decrease score by 10-20 points).
   - Missing or incorrect tool usage (decrease score by 10-15 points).
